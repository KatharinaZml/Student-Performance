Dataset description:
The Student Performance dataset was designed to examine the factors forecasting studentsâ€™ (academic) performance. It consists of 10,000 student records and five independent variables and performance index, the dependent variable:

Independent / Feature Variables:

Hours Studied: The total number of hours spent studying by each student.
Previous Scores: The scores obtained by students in previous tests.
Extracurricular Activities: Whether the student participates in extracurricular activities (Yes or No).
Sleep Hours: The average number of hours of sleep the student had per day.
Sample Question Papers Practiced: The number of sample question papers the student practiced.

Dependent / Target Variable:

Performance Index: A measure of the overall performance of each student. The performance index represents the student's academic performance and has been rounded to the nearest integer. The index ranges from 10 to 100, with higher values indicating better performance.

The analysis provides insights into relation between five feature and one target variable. Independent variables in this dataset are each student's: (1) total study hours, (2) the obtained score in previous tests, (3) if they engaged in extracurricular activities, (4) the average sleeping hours, and finally, (5) the amount of sample question papers practised and the target student's academic performance.

Note: This dataset is a synthetic and created for illustrative purposes. The relationships between the variables and the performance index may not reflect real-world scenarios.
